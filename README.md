# Brain Sugar 

Brain Sugar is an addictive rendition of the popular trivia game, Jeopardy. This version allows three players to face off answering questions within four categories. Points are awarded based on the value of the question answered, and if answered incorrectly the questions point value is subtracted from their score. To keep you on your toes, one question on the game board is a hidden Daily Double! Whichever player happens to choose it gets to submit a unique wager of their choice.

## Reflection

Brain Sugar was a great project to test our new skills in OOP and test-driven-development. Incorporating multiple classes on multiple JavaScript files was a new challenge for us. It was difficult when a single function would affect multiple other files in you scripts. Another hurdle was the introduction of testing, which we had never before had to implement in a project.  This was also our first project having to use a linter over our code. With all of these new obstacles we learned how to write an effective testing suite, how to run eslint over a file, and how to utilize object oriented programming. We ended up with a fun and functional game that is both pleasant to look at and intuitive. We would like to next implement round two and final round functionality.
