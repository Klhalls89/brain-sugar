# Brain Sugar 

Brain Sugar is a rendition of the popular trivia game, Jeopardy. This version allows three players to face off answering questions within four categories. Points are awarded based on the value of the question answered, and if answered incorrectly the questions point value is subtracted from their score. To keep you on your toes, one question on the game board is a hidden Daily Double! Whichever play happens to choose it gets to submit a unique wager of their choice.
